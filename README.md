# FinalProject-HarvardCourse
Final project from harvard's web development online free course with python, django, javascript, html and css.

Virtual closet is an application developed to help people organize their clothes and create different looks, it is really useful for people that work
with fashion, or for someone that likes fashion in general, since you can go trough all clothes you own and it gets much easier to think about what to wear
without the need of going to your house and looking at your physical wardrope.

Below there are a few images of the project:
